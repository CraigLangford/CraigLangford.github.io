# Writing SHA-256 in Python

SHA-256 has become an incredibly useful cryptographic function. It has the
capability to convert any data into a unique 32-byte string (256 bits
respectively). The real magic comes from its following two properties.

1. Any change in the incoming data will produce a completely new and unique
   32-byte string (if two pieces of data can produce the same string it is
   called a collision and can be an enormous security problem)
2. The original data cannot be reproduced from the hash, therefore the function
   is one directional. This means the hash can be shared freely without any
   fear of the original data being

Go ahead and try below. I guarantee you will not be able to obtain the same key
for any two strings. Change a single leter to a capital, add a single comma, or
swap two values and you'll get a completely different hash. 
<form id="sha256form" action="" title="" method="post">
  <div class="form-group">
    <textarea class="form-control" id="id_inputMessage" name="inputMessage" placeholder="Message to convert"></textarea>
  </div>
  <div class="text-center">
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" id="id_sha256Button">
      Run SHA-256
    </button>
  </div>
</form>
<div class="text-center">
  <div class="alert alert-info" id="id_outputDigest" style="margin-top: 15px;">
    SHA-256 Digest
  </div>
</div>

How (not why, that's worth a post in itself) exactly does the SHA-256 do this?
Well, lets make our own SHA-256 function to find out! This post will work
through the Python function created which is actually running above.

## Preprocessing Data

The first thing to do is to create a function that takes in a string and
converts it to binary. In this example we'll limit our data to string values
for representation sake. With this we can easily convert teach value to it's
unicode code point by using Python's `ord()` function and convert this integer
to binary by using Python 3's format function.


```python
def _str_to_bin(data_string):
    """Returns the binary representation of a string using unicode (or ASCII)
       representation of the string values

    args:
        data_string (str): Incoming string in unicode/ASCII format

    return args:
        binary_data (str): Binary representation of the string
    """
    print("String values:", list(data_string))
    unicode_points = [ord(char) for char in data_string]
    print("Unicode points:", unicode_points)
    binary_values = ['{0:08b}'.format(point) for point in unicode_points]
    print("Binary values:", binary_values)
    binary_data = ''.join(binary_values)
    print('Binary data: ', binary_data)
    return binary_data

binary_data = _str_to_bin('abc')
```

    String values: ['a', 'b', 'c']
    Unicode points: [97, 98, 99]
    Binary values: ['01100001', '01100010', '01100011']
    Binary data:  011000010110001001100011


Now that we have our binary data we need to preprocess it to have it in the
correct format for the future SHA-256 functions. This is is achieved with the
following three properties.

1. A 1 is added to the end of the binary data.
2. The length of the binary data (3 x 8 = 24) is appended to the end of the
   binary blob in a 64 bit number.
3. The final 1 and the 64 bit number from 1. and 2. are separated by 0s so that
   the total length of the binary blob is a multiple of 512.

*Preprocessing Data*
![Preprocessing Data](/assets/images/preprocessing-sha-256-data.png)

The purpose of this step is to have 512 bit blocks which will be used for each step of the SHA-256 process. Furthermore, this 512 bit block will be used in 16 smaller 32 bit blocks for each sub-process of each step. Therefore, for the data to be easily used, and in binary format it is also converted back to int 512 bit tuples each with 16 32-bit integers.


```python
def preprocess_data(binary_data):
    print("Binary data:", binary_data)
    data_length = '{0:064b}'.format(len(binary_data))
    print("Length:", len(binary_data), "bits")
    print(len(binary_data), "in 64 bit binary format:", data_length)
    padding = '0' * (512 - (len(binary_data) + 1 + 64) % 512)
    print("Padding needed for a 512 bit block:", len(padding), "0s")
    binary_string = binary_data + '1' + padding + data_length
    print("Final binary string:", binary_string)
    processed_values = [int(binary_string[i:i + 32], 2)
                        for i in range(0, len(binary_string), 32)]
    output_data = [tuple(processed_values[i:i + 16]) 
                   for i in range(0, len(processed_values), 16)]
    print("Final data ints for processing: ", output_data)
    return output_data

preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(binary_data)
```

    $ Binary data: 011000010110001001100011
    $ Length: 24 bits
    $ 24 in 64 bit binary format: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000
    $ Padding needed for a 512 bit block: 423 0s
    $ Final binary string: 01100001011000100110001110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011000
    $ Final data ints for processing:  [(1633837952, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 24)]


## Bitwise Operations Used for SHA-256

So far we haven't touched anything to do with the SHA-256 process. The power of
SHA-256 comes from two main factors:

1. Completely random seed values
2. A number of bitwise operations (operations which move 1s and 0s around in a
   specific manor)

The bitwise operations used in SHA-256 are as follows.

***Rotate right operation (ROTR)***<br>
Rotates the binary data right n units, for example:<br>
ROTR(100010, 1) --> 010001<br>
ROTR(100010, 2) --> 101000

***Shift right operation (SHR)***
<br>Same as ROTR, however, data on the right side is lost and the left side is
filled with 0s<br>
SHR(100010, 1) --> 010001<br>
SHR(100010, 2) --> 001000

***Choose operation (Ch)***<br>
Takes 3 equal length binary values, x, y, and z. For each binary value the
operation checks if x is 1 or 0. If x is 1, the value is chosen from y and if x
is 0 the value is chosen from z.

| x      | | 1010 |
| y      | | 0011 |
| z      | | 1100 |
| output | | 0110 |


***Majority operation (Maj)***<br>
Takes 3 equal length binary values, x, y, and z. For each binary value the
operation checks the total numbers of 1s and 0s in x, y and z. If a majority of
the values are 1 the output is 1 for that position and if the majority are 0s
the output is 0.

| x      | | 1010 |
| y      | | 0011 |
| z      | | 1100 |
| output | | 1010 |

## The SHA-256 Seeds
Now that we have our manipulation functions, what are we going to do with them?
Well, in the SHA-256 function you begin with a random value which, as
recommended by the NSA, are "the first sixty-four bits of the fractional parts
of the square roots of the ninth through sixteenth prime numbers". These are as
below:

```
6a09e667 bb67ae85 3c6ef372 a54ff53a 510e527f 9b05688c 1f83d9ab 5be0cd19
```

Furthermore, the SHA-256 algorithm is interesting in that it continuously feeds
in random data in each scrambling iteration (64 iterations for each 512 bit
block). The random data that is fed in with each iteration is seen below as
well, called K. You can see there are 8x8 seeds which makes the total of 64
seeds to pass in.

## Just Give Me the Algorithm Already!
Alright, there's been a lot of background to set up for the actual function.
Alas, here it is. Starting with the beginner seed from above we split it into 8
sections called a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h. So:

```
a = 6a09e667
b = bb67ae85
c = 3c6ef372
d = a54ff53a
e = 510e527f
f = 9b05688c
g = 1f83d9ab
h = 5be0cd19
```
From here on we calculate a new set of a - h. In each step b becomes a, c
becomes b, d becomes c, etc. However, the key is that both a and d are added
with a random value called W, T1 and T2. W is calculated for the first 16
iterations from the raw data (that we preprocessed earlier). From the 16th to
64th iteration, however, it is calculated as follows.
```
new_W = sigma_1(W[t-2]) + W[t-7] + sigma_0(W[t-15]) + W[t-16]
```
T1 and T2 are also calculated as below, where K is each piece of the 64 seeds
from above:
```
T1 = h + Epsilon_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K[t] + W[t]
T2 = Epsilon_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c)
```
Now we can calculate our new a - h values, with Python we can easily assign all
these in a single line.
```python
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h = T1 + T2, a, b, c, d + T1, e, f, g
```
Repeat this 64 times and you're done! The full algorithm can be seen below.
```python
def sha256(input_message):
    """Performs the SHA-256 algorithm on the incoming string. This is performed
       by converting the string to a binary string via unicode positions on
       which the permutations are performed. The result is then converted to a
       hexidecimal string and returned from the function

    args:
        input_message (str): Incoming string to be converted to SHA-256 digest

    output args:
        sha_256_digest (str):

    """
    binary_data = str_to_bin(input_message)
    M = preprocess_data(binary_data)
    for i in range(len(M)):
        a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h = H[i]

        W = list(M[i])
        for t in range(64):
            if t >= 16:
                new_W = sigma_1(W[t-2]) + W[t-7] + sigma_0(W[t-15]) + W[t-16]
                W.append(hex8(new_W))
            T1 = hex8(h + Epsilon_1(e) + Ch(e, f, g) + K[t] + W[t])
            T2 = hex8(Epsilon_0(a) + Maj(a, b, c))
            e, f, g, h = hex8(d + T1), e, f, g
            a, b, c, d = hex8(T1 + T2), a, b, c

        H.append([
            hex8(a + H[i][0]),
            hex8(b + H[i][1]),
            hex8(c + H[i][2]),
            hex8(d + H[i][3]),
            hex8(e + H[i][4]),
            hex8(f + H[i][5]),
            hex8(g + H[i][6]),
            hex8(h + H[i][7]),
        ])

    return ' '.join(['{:08x}'.format(val).upper() for val in H[-1]])
```
As you can see the supporting functions are missing. Check out my
[Github](https://github.com/CraigLangford/Cryptographic-Functions) (there's
full installation instructions) if you want the fully tested, and fully
functioning function! Furthermore, the field at the top of this blog is
actually connected through Amazon Lambda and is the live functioning python
code calculating your new SHA-256 digests!
