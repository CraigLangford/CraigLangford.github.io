I am a backend developer currently working on cutting edge solutions to help
bring cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, to the investment world. Working in
the startup scene has given me the opportunity to work on all aspects of the
stack, from processing transactions on the blockchain level, to creating APIs
for front-end applications. These experiences have given me a passion for
backend development where I am always aiming to create reliable, functional
code quickly via testing, code reviews and documentation.

To keep up with new technologies, I love working on side projects to explore
new technologies. This has resulted in the creation of Puzzle Spin (Android
and Web), Balloon Bird (Android), Crypto-Price (Amazon Echo) and more. If
you're looking for help for your open source projects let me know and I'd be
happy to help! Also, I am a frequenter of VimGolf and am always up for a round.
