<p>I am a full stack developer currently working on cutting edge solutions to
help bring cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to the investment world. Working in
such a rapidly growing space in the startup scene has given me the opportunity
to work from the blockchain level, creating and processing transactions, all
the way to front-end applications, with RESTful APIs. I am always excited to
learn new technologies to continue my growth throughout my career.</p>

<p>During my free time I love working on side projects that allow the freedom
to explore new technologies. This has resulted in the creation of Puzzle Spin
(Android and Web), Balloon Bird (Android), Crypto-Price (Amazon Echo) and more.
Recently I've been looking to contribute to some open source projects. If
you're looking for any help, let me know! I am also a frequenter of VimGolf and
am always up for a round</p>
